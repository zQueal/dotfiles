# hosted dotfiles

These are the dotfiles that I use for ArchLabs.

Changes are tracked with Git, and hosted here.

Everything else is managed with GNU Stow.

# How

1. Install `stow`
2. Create `.dotfiles`
3. Create folders for each dotfile group, git, vim, zsh, etc
4. Move those folders to `.dotfiles`
5. Run stow; `stow vim`
6. Stow creates all the syslinks for you
7. Profit?
